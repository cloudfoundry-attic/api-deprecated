# gosexy/to

*Convenient* functions for converting values between common Go datatypes.

What if, instead of producing errors because your (human) user did not feed
correctly formatted data into your program, you try to make your code get over
it and keep going? Remember that, for any *sane* human, the string `"5"` is
exactly the same thing as the uint `5` (or was it a `uint64`?) and a *number*
could be "12.34", even if your program expects only integers.

Life is too short for properly catching trivial conversion errors and for
bothering users with silly computer details, such as the difference between
`"123"` and `123`.

This package allows quick conversions between Go datatypes, when any conversion
seems unreasonable, a [zero value][3] of the expected type is always guaranteed.

Please be aware that this package does not consider conversion errors to be
important enough to be returned or handled, if some conversion error happens it
instead returns the [zero value][3] with no additional drama. If you're not
working with human provided data, fuzzy input or if you prefer not to ignore
any error in your program, you'd better use the standard Go packages for
conversion, such as [strconv][4] or even [fmt][5], they may be better suited
for the task.

## Installation

```sh
go get -u menteslibres.net/gosexy/to
```

## Usage

Import the package

```go
import "menteslibres.net/gosexy/to"
```

Use the available `to` functions to convert a `float64` into a `string`:

```go
// "1.23"
s := to.String(1.23)
```

Or a `bool` into `string`:

```go
// "true"
s := to.String(true)
```

What about the other way around? `string` to `float64` and `string` to `bool`.

```go
// 1.23
f := to.Float64("1.23")

// true
b := to.Bool("true")
```

Note that this package only provides `to.Uint64()`, `to.Int64()` and
`to.Float64()` but no `to.Uint8()`, `to.Uint()` or `to.Float32()` functions, if
you'd like to produce a `float32` instead of a `float64` you'd first use
`to.Float64()` and then cast the output using `float32()`.

```go
f32 := float32(to.Float64("12.34"))
```

There is another important function, `to.Convert()` that accepts any value
(`interface{}`) as first argument and also a `reflect.Kind`, as second, that
defines the data type the first argument will be converted to, this is also
the only function that returns an `error` value.

```go
val, err := to.Convert("12345", reflect.Int64)
```

Date formats and durations are also handled, you can use many fuzzy date formats
and they would be converted into `time.Time` values.

```go
timeVal = to.Time("2012-03-24")
timeVal = to.Time("Mar 24, 2012")

durationVal := to.Duration("12s37ms")
```

Now, an important question: how fast is this library compared to standard
methods, like the `fmt` or `strconv` packages?

It is, of course, a little slower that `strconv` methods but it is faster than
`fmt`, so it provides an acceptable speed for most projects. You can test it by
yourself:

```sh
$ go test -test.bench=.
